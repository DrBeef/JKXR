# JK XR

[SideQuest Latest Version (Meta Headsets)](https://sidequestvr.com/app/15472)

[SideQuest Latest Version (Pico Headsets)](https://sidequestvr.com/app/)

JK XR is a VR port of the Jedi Knight games using OpenXR (the open standard for virtual and augmented reality devices) and is based on the excellent OpenJK port, originally forked from: https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK

This is currently built for standalone VR HMDs (see the Building section below) and will currently **not** run on any other device, the list of supported devices is: Meta Quest (1, 2, Pro) and Pico (3 & 4).

Support for PCVR based devices will hopefully come in the future.

The easiest way to install this on your device is using SideQuest. Download SideQuest here:

### Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast

The public release of JK XR currently supports the game Jedi Outcast; access to the Jedi Academy early-access build can be found on the Team Beef patreon (link below). However there are lots of mods and access to the free demo level available through the accomapnying JK XR Companion App, which is also installed alongside JK XR on SideQuest.

### Gameplay Modes (accessible via Setup -> Difficulty in the Menu)

**Team Beef Directors Cut (TBDC) - On (Default is On)**
This version uses faithful enemy speeds and aggression from the original game, which are fast and challenging by modern standards. To balance this projectile speeds and gun power are raised to feel more canon to the Star Wars movies and prevent Stormtroopers and other enemies from being able to avoid gunfire by strafing. There are also exaggerated knockback effects. This mode is more arcade-y fast paced affair whilst feeling similar to the difficulty level of the twitch-based gameplay of the original game. 

**Team Beef Directors Cut (TBDC) - Off**
Projectile speeds are faithful to the original game, but enemy movement and aggression are toned back, where stormtroopers don't have an easy time to flank you. You may need to still "lead" shots slightly ahead of enemies when they are on the move. Recommended for a slower paced tactical encounter

To switch between modes change the option and if already in-game, restart the level you are on.

### Companion App

The companion app will be installed at the same time when using the SideQuest official page. This allows you to download mods and addons and switch between launching single player missions and the main game. This also detects if you've correctly set up the main application and asset files so is a good place to look if you are having issues.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

*This is just an engine port*; the apk does not contain any of the of Jedi Knight game assets. If you wish to play the full game you must purchase it yourself, steam is most straightforward:  https://store.steampowered.com/app/6030/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_II__Jedi_Outcast/

# Installation and Setup

You can find the latest version, which also includes the Companion App hosted on Sidequest. Use the links at the top of the page (separated by headset). Before installing via SideQuest you must have enabled "Developer Mode" on your headset. You can find the details on how to do that below:

## Copying the Full Game files to your Oculus Quest

Before you are able to run the full game of Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast in VR you will need to:

- Install JK XR thought SideQuest (this will also install the companion app)
- Start JK XR for the first time, it will ask for appropriate permissions (which you must allow), create the necessary folders and then close down
- You can now run the Companion App. This will check that it has the files for the full game. 
- (optional) Copy only the assets files (assets0.pk3, assets1.pk3, assets2.pk3, assets5.pk3) from your PC install of JKO (Jedi Outcast\GameData\base) into the following folder on your device:

\JKXR\JK2\base

- You must then use the Companion App to download any mods and start the game. It is possible to play the JK Demo without having copied across the full game assets. All other mods require the full game. 


### Save Games File

Save game files are stored on the internal memory of your device. This means that if you uninstall/reinstall JK XR all the saves are retained. If you change headset just make sure you copy your saves to the new device.
Any update will not affect any of your save game files.


## Controls and configuration

### Tutorials 

You can find tutorial videos on how to use the special VR features in the in-game Controls -> JKXR HELP menu.

## Building from Source

If you wish to build JK XR from source, then you need the following:

* Android Developer Studio
* Android SDK API level 24
* Latest Android Native Development Kit
* The OpenXR release archive for your headset

There is no dependency on any specific headset native libraries, as this port uses OpenXR and links against the opensource Android openxr_loader.so. If you wish to build for a specific headset, then you need to place the openxr_loader.so for the headset into the following folder and rename it to:  openxr_loader_{device}.so  where {device} is either *meta* or *pico* (further device support hopefully in the future):

JKXR\Projects\Android\libs\arm64-v8a
