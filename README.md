JKXR is a VR port using OpenXR (the open standard for virtual and augmented reality devices) is based on the excellent OpenJK port, originally forked from: https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK

This is currently built solely for standalone VR HMDs and will **not** run on any other device, currently the list of supported devices is: Meta Quest (1, 2, Pro) and Pico (3 & 4).

Support for PCVR based devices will hopefully come in the future.

The easiest way to install this on your device is using SideQuest, a Desktop app designed to simplify sideloading apps and games.
