Well, I made a thing. A pretty Thing.

I originally made this for the DF2 mod which will feature a PBR version of this model but decided to release a version for the base game

Title : HapSlash's Improved Stormtrooper - JO
Author : HapSlash
E-Mail : slash_happy@yahoo.com
Website : www.hapslash.com

File Name : Haps-Stormtrooper.pk3
File Size : 1.23MB
Date Released : 02-27-04

Description
The first pk3 includes the Improved Stormtrooper model, which features accurate movie stylings, team skins, complete caps, and full LOD support . This file is set up to replace the default Stormtrooper.

Also included is a second pk3 which will replace the 3rd person
Stormtrooper blaster with my own version of the E-11.

Installation
Simply extract both pk3's to the gamedata/base folder of your Jedi Outcast
directory.

Comments
First of all I think that thank's are in order to INFINITY BLADE, who
took the time to weight the model & convert it almost 5 times before the
finished product was released. Without him this project never would have
gotten very far.

I originally started this upgrade due to the number of problems I had
with the original. The main changes are primarily in the head, torso,
and knees, with texture changes throughout. Other than the cosmetic
changes I also noticed that not all of the body sections had caps on
them, with this model I've added them all in.

Well here it is, my first released model. A lot of hard work, blood,
sweat, tears, and almost a years worth of procrastination went into this,...

Enjoy.

TITLE: REAL sounds
AUTHOR: neo
E-MAIL: neo_mp5@hotmail.com
WEBSITE: none

FILENAME: myskin.zip
FILESIZE: 768 KB
DATE RELEASED: 28 september 2005

CREDITS: ben burtt, for his original sounds, and dveditor, for getting ahold of several of the sounds
themselves (http://boards.theforce.net/Fan_Films/b10015/20495395/?278).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: just drop each wav over the wav of the same name in the folder of the
same name. If there's an easier way to do this, please let me know.

If you don't want a specific sound, you can just leave it out. If you want to change it back, I suggest you back
up the original sounds somewhere.

DESCRIPTION: I HATE the sound work in this game, so I figured I'd replace as many as possible with the
REAL sounds. these sounds are top possible quality, not just movie rips.

BUGS: it's too simple to have bugs

COMMENTS: this is my first mod, and I intend to make more sound mods, and update this one, if possible. I would
replace the sounds to the repeater and the force lightning loop, but I can't figure out how to make a wav with
a bitrate of 352 kbps. my audio programs only go to 320. help would be appreciated

If volumes are off, please inform me. If yyou want a specific sound from the movies made into another mod,
I likely have the sound, and can probably do that, so e-mail me.
