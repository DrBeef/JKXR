 * - form a common pointer type (slot_rep*),
 * - offer the possibility to create duplicates (dup()),
 * - offer a notification callback (notify()),
 * - implement some of slot_base's interface that depends

 *   -# the possibility to set a single parent with a callback
 *      (set_parent()) that is executed from notify(),
 *   -# a generic function pointer, call_, that is simply
 *      set to zero in notify() to invalidate the slot.
